CSC_452_Labs
============

This repository is for tracking all my lab assignments for the CSC452 - Principles of Operating Systems course at the UofA

For the purposes of the assignments, a tiny bare bones OS known as 'DLXOS' is used. It will be modified to learn and implement
various OS features such as system calls, scheduling and memory management.

The link to the DLXOS , which is based on the DLX architecture (and uses a simulator known as DLXSim) can be found in the link 
below :

LAB 1 
======

Aim of LAB 1 is to implement a simple system call (Getpid () ) which , you can guess, returns the PID of the calling proces.
